HOW TO USE
------------------------

00. generate process

    ./gen_files.sh [ngluons]
    
    This command generates needed files for gg > (ngluons -2) event generation

0. modify 
   cparam.inc
	icf: Color Summation mode
	ich_type: channel types to be used
	nch: the number of integration channels
	nwgt: the number of jacobians which covers some singularities in the matrix element
	ipdf: whether use pdf(1) or not(0)
	ndist: the number of distributions bases plots

   userin.f (setting file for the main program)
	EBMUP: the energy of the beam 1 & 2
	PTcut: the pTcut for jets
	AYEcut: the rapidity cut for jets
	rcut: the dR cut between jets
	lptcut: the pTcut for the leading jets (in pT)
	ipdfset: the id number for the pdf set used (LesHouchAccord)
	QQ: the factorization scale
	alfas: the alpha_s coupling
	Qcut: the minimum invariant mass of the s-channel off-shell particle
	Qmax: the maximum invariant mass of the s-channel off-shell particle
	nsample_cf: the number of color flows to be sampled per phase space point
	
  	Please also modify the histogram setting at the bottom of the file according to the bases rule. (the number of distributions is fixed by ndist in cparam.inc

   run_bases (setting file for BASES)
	ACC1: the required accuracy for the grid optimization
	ACC2: the required accuracy for the integration
	ITM1: the maximum number of iteration for the grid optimization
	ITM2: the maximum number of iteration for the integration

   bfunc.f: clculation of the integrand for the phase space integration
	modify it for the process to be generated 
	1. gench_pshk*
	2. impose_cuts
	3. get_chjacob_diagram
	4. smatrix
	5. switch_mom part
	6. order_pt

1. running
   ./run.sh
   
   This will run following commands:
	./get_numch: read the number of channels
	./run_bases: phase space integration
	./get_nevent:    
	./makedat_bases.sh
	./combine_dat
	./mkgnu_z.sh
	./mkgnu_bases.sh
	./run_spring: event generation
	./combine_plot.sh
	./combine_uwgteff.sh
	./mkgnu_wgtunwgt.sh

   Verify your result
       1. Check that your integration reaches the desired accuracy before go to event generation step by checking rslt_[run_name]/output/log_bases_[run_name]_[ch_number]. If the integration acuracy is not enough even after 5 iterations, it would be better to increase NCAL, not increasing ITM1.

       2. Check that your event generation does not miss generation (1 or 2 miss would be fine) by checking "miss_gen" in  rslt_[run_name]/output/summary.txt. If this happen, it implys that the integration step did not find all the peak in the integrand sufficiently. Take mxtry larger or decrease ACC or increase NCAL.

       3. Check the distributions reported. 
       	  plot_distc.eps: The unweighted distributions should agree with the weighted one (or a little bit smaller. should not be larger). If this happens, consider to increase NCAL or decrease ACC's. 

	  plot_intvar_[ch_number]: The distributions for integration variable should not show any narrow peak more than 2 order than the average. If this happens, change the channeling, jacobian or integration variables. 

2. plotting by yourself
   After generating events, do following.
   	 maplot.sh [run_name]
	 ./makedat.sh [run_name]
	 ./mkgnu.sh [run_name1] [run_name2] ...

   The plots are outputted in "pots" folder
