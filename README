HOW TO INSTALL THIS PACKAGE
------------------------
./makelibs.sh

modify maplot.sh
  LINE 12: set topdrawer for linux or mac

------------------------
QUICK START (TEST RUN)
------------------------
* Here we are going to generate events for gg > 3g process in serial computation
1. ./gen_files.sh 5
2. ./run.sh run_name 10000 0 0 3 0
* See run.sh for more details about the arguments 

* For parallel computation (* LSF like Job Management System Only *)
1. ./gen_files.sh 5
2. set cluster=kekcc in run.sh
3. set que in run.sh (e.g. que=e/s/l/h for KEKCC cluster)
4. ./run.sh run_name 10000 1 0 3 0
* This time ./run.sh performs the parallel computation twice: grid optimization and event generation for an adoptive MonteCarlo integration. Each time, the calculation results of all nodes will be gathered and combined.

	1. gench_pshk*
	2. impose_cuts
	3. get_chjacob_diagram
	4. smatrix
	5. switch_mom part
	6. order_pt

1. running
   ./run.sh
	./get_numch: read the number of channels
	./run_bases: phase space integration
	./get_nevent:    
	./makedat_bases.sh
	./combine_dat
	./mkgnu_z.sh
	./mkgnu_bases.sh
	./run_spring: event generation
	./combine_plot.sh
	./combine_uwgteff.sh
	./mkgnu_wgtunwgt.sh

   Verify your result
       1. Check that your integration reaches the desired accuracy before go to event generation step by checking rslt_[run_name]/output/log_bases_[run_name]_[ch_number]. If the integration acuracy is not enough even after 5 iterations, it would be better to increase NCAL, not increasing ITM1.

       2. Check that your event generation does not miss generation (1 or 2 miss would be fine) by checking "miss_gen" in  rslt_[run_name]/output/summary.txt. If this happen, it implys that the integration step did not find all the peak in the integrand sufficiently. Take mxtry larger or decrease ACC or increase NCAL.

       3. Check the distributions reported. 
       	  plot_distc.eps: The unweighted distributions should agree with the weighted one (or a little bit smaller. should not be larger). If this happens, consider to increase NCAL or decrease ACC's. 

	  plot_intvar_[ch_number]: The distributions for integration variable should not show any narrow peak more than 2 order than the average. If this happens, change the channeling, jacobian or integration variables. 

2. plotting by yourself
   After generating events, do following.
   	 maplot.sh [run_name]
	 ./makedat.sh [run_name]
	 ./mkgnu.sh [run_name1] [run_name2] ...

   The plots are outputted in "pots" folder
